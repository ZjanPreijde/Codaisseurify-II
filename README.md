Testing if I'm back on track

# App - Codaisseurify-II

**Moving forward, based on Codaisseurify**



#### Assignment - Basic Requirements

### Adding AJAX

Refactor some of the existent functionalities in the artist detail page to meet the following requirements:

- Visitors can add songs related to an artist **via AJAX**. This should happen in the show page of the artist.
- Visitors can remove songs related to an artist **via AJAX**. This should happen in the show page of the artist.
- Visitors can delete all songs for that artist with only one click **via AJAX**. This should happen in the show page of the artist.
- You will not `reload()` your page, but you will use DOM manipulation.

### Testing

- Write some integration tests related to the three new functionalities that you just added:
  - Add a new song
  - Remove a song
  - Remove all songs

## Submission

Send the following information: **before 20:00, Sunday, January 28th 2018**

- Link to the repository in Github where your app lives.

To this email address: **teachers@codaisseur.com**.



***COMMIT OFTEN!***



Replace 

- for add song, delete song
- replace Rails submit button model_path add/delete functionality 
- with events handled by Javascript/jQuery
- and replace action with AJAX-requests (POST, DELETE)
- update info without page reload

Add

- functionality for delete all songs
- for each song send DELETE AJAX-request
- update info without page reload

Remove (not requested, but let's get rid of it)

- Photo upload for artist
- Delete artist ?





Create a song

* POST, songs#create, artists/:artist_id/songs/new


POST

* -i
* -H "Accept: application/json"
* -H "Content-type: application/json"
* -X POST
* -d  '{"title":"New Title"}'
* http://localhost:3000/api/artists/1/songs



Test: Title must be filled

May respond with 

- either 200 OK and {"message": "Song succesfully created", "song":{"id":1, "title":"Title", "artist_id":1, "created_at":"2018-etc", "updated_at":"2018-etc"}}
- or 422 Unprocessable Entity and {"errors": {"field":["validation error"]}}
- where "errors" can be many errors for each field, and error many fields

In this case probably {"errors":{"title";["can't be blank"]}}

If uniqueness is enforced, probably also other error message



Delete a song

- DELETE, songs#destroy, artists/:artist_id/songs/:song_id

DELETE

* -i
* -H "Accept: application/json"
* -H "Content-type: application/json"
* -X DELETE
* http://localhost:3000/api/artists/1songs/1


May respond with 

- either 200 OK and {"message": "Song succesfully deleted"}}
- or ??

If song would have dependants, and no *dependent: :destroy* or not able to destroy dependants, there would probably be some error



UPDATE (not used for Codaisseurify-II)

- -i
- -H "Accept: application/json"
- -H "Content-type: application/json"
- -X PUT
- http://localhost:3000/api/artists/1songs/1

May respond with 

- either 200 OK and {"message": "The song could not be updated", "room":{"fields": "values"}}
- or 422 Unprocessable Entity and {"errors": {"field":["validation error"]}}




####Taken from the reader, we'll only do add and delete (all) :



Integration testing, setup

```ruby
# Gemfile

# ...

group :development, :test do
  # ...
  gem 'rspec-rails'
  gem 'capybara'
  gem 'selenium-webdriver'
  gem "chromedriver-helper"
end

group :test do
  gem 'database_cleaner'
end

```



```shell
$ bundle install
$ rake db:create && rake db:migrate && rake db:seed
$ rails g rspec:install
$ rails s

```



Add the following two imports in `spec/rails_helper.rb` after the line that says: `# Add additional requires below this line. Rails is not loaded until this point!`

```ruby
# spec/rails_helper.rb

require 'capybara/rspec'
require 'capybara/rails'
```

You need to uncomment the following line as well:

```ruby
Dir[Rails.root.join('spec/support/**/*.rb')].each { |f| require f }
```

And assign `config.use_transactional_fixtures` to false, instead than true:

```ruby
config.use_transactional_fixtures = false
```

And ad the end of the `rails_helper.rb` file (below the end of the `RSpec.configure` block), add these lines:

```ruby
Capybara.register_driver :selenium do |app|
  Capybara::Selenium::Driver.new(app, browser: :chrome)
end
```



## Setting up DatabaseCleaner

Then add a configuration file for DatabaseCleaner in `spec/support/database_cleaner.rb`:

```ruby
# spec/support/database_cleaner.rb

RSpec.configure do |config|

  config.use_transactional_fixtures = false

  config.before(:suite) do
    if config.use_transactional_fixtures?
      raise(<<-MSG)
        Delete line `config.use_transactional_fixtures = true` from rails_helper.rb
        (or set it to false) to prevent uncommitted transactions being used in
        JavaScript-dependent specs.

        During testing, the app-under-test that the browser driver connects to
        uses a different database connection to the database connection used by
        the spec. The app's database connection would not be able to access
        uncommitted transaction data setup over the spec's database connection.
      MSG
    end
    DatabaseCleaner.clean_with(:truncation)
  end  

  config.before(:each) do
    DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :transaction
  end

  config.before(:each, type: :feature) do
    # :rack_test driver's Rack app under test shares database connection
    # with the specs, so continue to use transaction strategy for speed.
    driver_shares_db_connection_with_specs = Capybara.current_driver == :rack_test

    if !driver_shares_db_connection_with_specs
      # Driver is probably for an external browser with an app
      # under test that does *not* share a database connection with the
      # specs, so use truncation strategy.
      DatabaseCleaner.strategy = :truncation
    end
  end

  config.before(:each) do
    DatabaseCleaner.start
  end

  config.append_after(:each) do
    DatabaseCleaner.clean
  end

end
```



API setup


```ruby
# config/routes.rb

Rails.application.routes.draw do
  # rest of the code...

  namespace :api do
    resources :songs
  end
end
```



Make (folder and) file

*app/controllers/api/songs_controller.rb*

```ruby
# app/controllers/api/songs_controller.rb

class Api::SongsController < ApplicationController
  def index
    render status: 200, json: {
      rooms: Song.all
    }.to_json
  end
end
```



*In browser*, http://localhost:3000/api/songs.json, returns JSON-formatted data

*In shell*

```shell
$ curl http://localhost:3000/api/songs/json
$ curl http://localhost:3000/api/songs/json | json_pp
```



```shell
$ git add .
$ git commit -m "Add API songs index"
$ git push -u origin master
```



```ruby
class Api::SongsController < ApplicationController
  # ...

  def show
    song = Song.find(params[:id])

    render status: 200, json: {
      song: song
    }.to_json
  end
end
```



```ruby
class Api::SongsController < ApplicationController
  # rest of the code...

 def create
    song = Song.new(song_params)

    if song.save
      render status: 201, json: {
        message: "Song successfully created",
        song: song
      }.to_json
    else
      render status: 422, json: {
        errors: song.errors
      }.to_json
    end
  end

  private

  def song_params
    params.require(:song).permit(:title)
  end
end
```





```ruby
# app/controllers/api/songs_controller.rb

class Api::SongsController < ApplicationController
  # rest of the code...

  def destroy
    song = Song.find(params[:id])
    song.destroy

    render status: 200, json: {
      message: "Song successfully deleted"
    }.to_json
  end

  private

  # rest of the code...
end
```



## Serialization

.as_json, .to_json, render :json



Active Model JSON Serializer, replaces default  JSON (de-)serialization



active_model_serializers gem, add in 

*.Gemfile*

```ruby
# Gemfile

# ...

# Add Active Model Serializers gem for API calls
gem 'active_model_serializers', '~> 0.10.0'

```

```shell
$ bundle install
$ rails generate serializer song
```

creates :

*app/serializers/song_serializer.rb*, why only *:title*?

```ruby
# app/serializers/song_serializer.rb

class SongSerializer < ActiveModel::Serializer
  attributes :title
end
```



Rewrite code serializer style

*app/controllers/api/songs_controller.rb*

```ruby
class Api::SongsController < ApplicationController
  skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token

  def index
    songs = Song.all
    render status: 200, json: songs
  end

  def show
    song = Song.find(params[:id])
    render status: 200, json: song
  end

  def create
    song = Song.new(song_params)

    if song.save
      render status: 200, json: song
    else
      render status: 422, json: {
        errors: song.errors
      }.to_json
    end
  end

  def destroy
    song = Song.find(params[:id])
    song.destroy

    render status: 200, json: {
      message: "Song successfully deleted"
    }.to_json
  end

  def update
    song = Song.find(params[:id])

    if song.update(song_params)
      render status: 200, json: song
    else
      render status: 500, json: {
        message: "The song could not be updated",
        errors: song.errors
      }.to_json
    end
  end

  private

  def song_params
    params.require(:song).permit(:title)
  end
end
```

test, add

```shell
$ curl -i -H "Accept: application/json" -H "Content-type: application/json" -X POST -d '{"title":"test song title","artist_id":"1"}' http://localhost:3000/api/songs
```

does not work : {"errors:{"artist":["must exist"]}}

replacing *"artist_id":"1"* with *"artist":"1"* also does not work







User verification, very interesting, but not in this stage :-) See reader.

In short : if authentication is used, you skip normal authentication and authenticate with secure tokens. These are stored both client-side and server-side and identify a user, using Devise, without using email/password.



* Create new base_controller.rb, 

* create a class within from ApplicationController, 

* let other Api controllers subclass from this one, in stead of from ApplicationController

* in a newly created base_controller.rb

* skip_before_action :verify_authenticity_token

* protect_from_forgery with :null_session

* before_action :authenticate

* ```
  $ rails g migration AddTokenToUsers token:string
  ```

* add *has_secure_token* to user model

* ```
  $ rails db:seed
  ```

* token should  be added as extra header of request, -H "X-USER-TOKEN: ... "

* CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing), allow for this by Rack CORS gem.
